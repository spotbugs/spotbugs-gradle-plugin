/**
 * The [Effort] is configuration to adjust SpotBugs detectors. Use lower effort to reduce
 * computation cost.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * Set via the `spotbugs` extension to configure all tasks in your project:
 * ```kotlin
 * // require Gradle 8.2+
 * import com.github.spotbugs.snom.Effort
 * spotbugs {
 *     effort = Effort.LESS
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Or via [SpotBugsTask] to configure the specific task in your project:
 * ```kotlin
 * // require Gradle 8.2+
 * import com.github.spotbugs.snom.Effort
 * spotbugsMain { // or name of another task
 *     effort = Effort.MAX
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * See also [SpotBugs Manual](https://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/effort.html).
